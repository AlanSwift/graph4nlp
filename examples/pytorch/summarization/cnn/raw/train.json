   "`` Women are Japan 's most underutilized resource . ''",
   "So said Japan 's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in April as he outlined a raft of measures aimed at closing the gender gap in the Japanese workforce .",
   "As a Western journalist new to Japan , it is a shock that it takes an economic argument to move the government to act toward more female participation in the workforce . But it 's not just a foreign perspective . The noted economist Noriko Hama writes in the Japan Times this week , `` You secure better working conditions for women because they have a rightful claim to such treatment . No other reasoning or justification is necessary to do something that is decent and just . ''",
   "Nevertheless , if you are a prime minister in urgent search of growth , the numbers behind so-called `` womenomics '' in Japan are compelling .",
   "` If you were to close the employment gap between Japanese men , which is 80 % , one of the highest in the OECD , with Japanese women -- which is still around 60 % -- we estimate that you 'd add about 8.2 million workers into the Japanese workforce , '' says Kathy Matsui of Goldman Sachs , who has long championed the cause . That influx of female workers `` could lift the asset level of Japanese GDP by as much as 14 % , '' she adds .",
   "Now Prime Minister Abe is trying to force corporations to act . He has set targets of at least one female executive per company and offered tax incentives to companies that encourage mothers to return to work .",
   "Despite equal employment opportunities enshrined into law in 1986 , real equality within most domestic Japanese companies remains within the realm of fantasy-land .",
   "Naoko Toyoda had worked for 10 years with an IT company but was demoted to a starting position when she came back after the birth of her first child . `` Women who choose not to have a child would continue up the corporate ladder while those who did would be forced into semi-retirement , '' she says .",
   "She did n't expect flexibility from the company 's side though . `` Once one exception is allowed , other mothers would complain they were n't treated in the same way , '' she says . So she quit .",
   "According to Goldman Sachs , some 70 % of Japanese women choose to leave the workforce after they 've had children . That 's more than twice the number in the U.S. or Germany .",
   "But unlike the U.S. and Germany -- where childcare is cited as the major factor for why women leave work -- in Japan , uncompromising work environments , which demand face-time and offer little career mobility for women , persuade most mothers to give up corporate life .",
   "A 2011 study by the Center for Work-Life Policy called `` Off-Ramps and On-Ramps Japan : Keeping Talented Women on the Road to Success '' found that three quarters of Japanese women want to rejoin the workforce after they 've had children , but only 43 % manage to get their careers back on track . Those who do return to work tend to take salary cuts and often find themselves , like Toyoda , marginalized within the company .",
   "Cosmetics giant Shiseido does better than most . Since 1990 its childcare support program has been in continual evolution , providing employees with extensive leaves of parental absence , shorter working hours , childcare subsidies and on-site nursery facilities . It is also working on a gender equality action plan to boost its ratio of female leaders though it admits it will miss its slated target of 30 % by end 2013 .",
   "Shigeto Ohtsuki , executive director of human resources at Shiseido , describes the management style in the past as `` very slow moving . '' Even though Shiseido is an example of corporate best practice in Japan , Ohtsuki admits there is still some way to go along the road towards true daibashitii , the Japanese word for diversity .",
   "`` The female leader ratio in Japan Shiseido Group , representing 25,000 employees is still 25.6 % whereas female leader ratio overseas where we have 20,000 employees is almost 60 % , '' Ohtsuki says .",
   "Yuki Honda joined Shiseido in 1989 . She met her husband there and they have two children . She feels grateful to the company for continuing to support and promote her throughout . `` I think I was fortunate with this company because they did not assume we women would quit after childbirth and they educated us so we 'd continue to work , '' she says .",
   "Japan 's bleak demographic outlook is well known . The birth-rate is shrinking , the population is getting older and there are fewer workers ' to pay for the nation 's pensioners . The IMF forecasts Japan 's population will shrink by around 30 % by 2055 .",
   "Abe 's push to make the workplace a more hospitable place for women -- quite apart from the argument that it 's just more fair -- is also a matter of economic survival .",
   "Whether Japan 's male corporate bosses are listening remains to be seen ."

   "-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What a week it 's been for Formula One ace Nico Rosberg .",
   "A new wife , a World Cup win for his beloved German football team and now a new contract with the Mercedes team .",
   "Rosberg heads to his home grand prix in Germany this weekend on cloud nine -- and still leading the 2014 world championship by four points from Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton .",
   "First came the wedding , as the 29-year-old married childhood sweetheart Vivian Sibold in Monaco last week .",
   "The celebrations carried on as Rosberg enjoyed a rare race free Sunday by watching Germany defeat Argentina to lift the World Cup for a fourth time .",
   "The Mercedes driver -- who had sportingly invited French Lotus driver Romain Grosjean to watch Germany defeat France in the quarterfinals after qualifying for the British Grand Prix -- plans to mark Germany 's triumph with a special helmet for his homecoming race .",
   "He will race around Hockenheim with football 's World Cup trophy at the centerpiece of a black , yellow and red design .",
   "Rosberg , the son of 1982 F1 world champion Keke , also goes to Germany with a multi-year contract extension in his back pocket .",
   "The former Williams racer , who joined Mercedes when the Silver Arrows returned to the sport in 2010 , has signed on for an unspecified number of seasons .",
   "`` I 'm looking forward to the next years together , '' said Rosberg , who has raced to six victories with the German team . `` We will keep pushing to win even more races -- and hopefully championships . ''",
   "Mercedes motorsport chief Toto Wolff said : `` Nico 's speed , commitment and focus have all helped to give clear direction and to drive the team forward since 2010 .",
   "`` With his performances in 2014 , Nico has demonstrated to the outside world what we already knew in the team ; that he is one of the very top drivers in Formula One . ''",
   "Rosberg made his F1 debut with Williams in 2006 but his reputation has grown at Mercedes , particularly as he proved equal to the sport 's seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher during their three years as teammates .",
   "Since replacing Schumacher in 2013 , Lewis Hamilton has provided another benchmark for Rosberg to measure himself against .",
   "The English 2008 world champion is generally perceived to be the quicker driver but Rosberg has shown in 2014 that he is developing into a more rounded racer .",
   "Hamilton signed a three-year contract when he joined Mercedes with the deal due to expire at the end of 2015 .",
   "From junior teammates and friends , Rosberg and Hamilton are now locked in an intriguing battle for the 2014 world title .",
   "Rosberg has won three races with Hamilton , who has lost valuable points with two retirements , taking five grand prix victories as the season reaches its halfway point .",
   "After Hamilton 's victory at the British Grand Prix put him back in the title hunt , Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda predicted of his Mercedes charges : `` They will fight until the end like you do not believe to be world champion . ''",
   "Rosberg may already be enjoying an annus mirabilis but he still has his eye on the prize he really wants -- his first F1 world title ."

   "RIO DE JANEIRO , Brazil -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Brazilian TV host denies authorities ' charges that he orchestrated the murders of drug dealers and other criminals to generate sensational footage for his show .",
   "TV host Wallace Souza is accused of ordering hits on criminal rivals and then covering the deaths for ratings .",
   "Wallace Souza , a state legislator and former host of a police TV show called `` Canal Livre , '' also was a drug trafficker , officials say . And to get rid of the competition -- and drive up ratings -- he would order that criminal rivals be killed and then would have his camera crews arrive first on the scene , authorities say .",
   "`` In truth , they went as far as creating acts , '' said Thomas Augusto Vasconcelos , intelligence secretary for Amazonas state . `` It 's been determined that the crimes were committed in order to generate news for the program . ''",
   "Souza has denied the accusations , and his lawyer has criticized key testimony and questioned the investigation .",
   "`` In all the investigations carried out by the public minister and the police , up to now they have not presented any technical evidence of any type , '' attorney Francisco Balieiro said on Brazilian TV .",
   "State officials say Souza faces charges of forming a criminal gang , corrupting testimony , drug trafficking and illegal possession of firearms . He remains free because of legislative immunity , officials say . Watch report on Souza 's former show , charges he faces ''",
   "State Attorney General Otavio Gomes told the Agencia Folha news outlet that Souza 's gang has been linked to six slayings . But prosecutor Pedro Bezerra told the news outlet he could not bring murder charges against Souza for lack of concrete evidence .",
   "The Amazonas State Justice Tribunal , which held a hearing on the accusations , said the criminal complaint was based on testimony by former Souza associate Moacir Jorge da Costa . After Jorge 's arrest , he talked about the gang 's reputed activities , including slayings .",
   "Souza 's lawyer , Balieiro , said police and public ministry officials did not have standing to investigate the TV show host because he is a legislator . Furthermore , Balieiro said , Jorge 's testimony was obtained in an irregular manner .",
   "According to the state public minister , who brought the charges against Souza , the legislator 's son , Raphael , belonged to the criminal gang . Raphael Souza has been convicted of homicide , drug trafficking and illegal gun possession .",
   "Fifteen people connected with Souza , among them police officers and a chief , have been arrested .",
   "Souza , a former police officer who left the force more than 20 years ago after being implicated in a fuel theft case , received the most votes of any candidate in the last election in Amazonas state . His TV show went off the air last year after the investigation into his possible criminal involvement intensified .",
   "He lives in the jungle city of Manaus , the capital of Amazonas state , a region of Brazil known for its prevalent lawlessness . Souza would often rail on his lunchtime show about the killings and other atrocities being committed in the area .",

   "A metal object that washed ashore on Australia 's coast was n't from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 , officials said .",
   "Detailed pictures of the object were enough to convince investigators that it was n't a lead in the search for the missing plane , the Australian agency leading the search for the aircraft said on Thursday .",
   "Officials had previously called the piece of metal , which appeared to have rivets on one side , an `` object of interest '' in the search .",
   "Police picked it up near Augusta , Australia , roughly 1,000 miles away from the suspected crash site , after many futile days of searching for the missing plane .",
   "Authorities have n't said what they think the object could be .",
   "Possible promising leads have turned out to be false alarms for weeks in the lengthy search for the missing plane , which disappeared mid-flight on March 8 with 239 people aboard . One major challenge that 's complicated the search : the ocean is full of garbage . Other objects search teams have spotted in the Indian Ocean turned out to be trash , jellyfish and fishing gear .",
   "Bad weather grounded planes searching for signs of debris on Wednesday . And a high-tech underwater drone found no sign of the Boeing 777 jetliner .",
   "If nothing turns up in the Bluefin-21 's underwater search , the investigation will move into a new phase that could involve new equipment and an expanded search area .",
   "And as the search came up empty again , a key question loomed : Are they looking in the right place ?",
   "`` They have been searching for more than a month . All of the ships , the planes , the satellites they 're using , not even a small piece of the plane was found , '' Steve Wang , whose mother was aboard the aircraft , told CNN 's `` The Lead with Jake Tapper '' on Thursday .",
   "Abbott : ` We may rethink the search , but we will not rest '",
   "Up to 11 military aircraft and 11 ships are set to search for the plane on Thursday .",
   "And there 's still ground left to cover .",
   "The Bluefin-21 has scanned more than 90 % of the underwater search area set out by investigators and began its 12th mission on Thursday .",
   "`` We will continue with the search operation until we fully cover the search area , '' Hishammuddin Hussein , Malaysia 's acting transport minister , said Wednesday .",
   "Despite the search efforts for MH370 repeatedly coming up empty during the 48 days since it started , there 's no suggestion the hunt in the southern Indian Ocean is anywhere close to ending .",
   "Quite to the contrary , according to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott , whose country is heading up the search for the missing aircraft .",
   "`` We are not going to abandon ... the families of the 239 people who were on that plane by lightly surrendering while there is reasonable hope of finding something , '' he said Wednesday . `` We may well rethink the search , but we will not rest until we have done everything we can to solve this mystery . ''",
   "What comes next ?",
   "Malaysian and Australian authorities are already mapping out a long-term strategy for the search , which could go on for months or years , if the two-year search for Air France Flight 447 is any guide .",
   "Guidelines drafted by Malaysia raise the possibility of a significantly wider search area should the current underwater search fail to turn up evidence of the plane . The document discusses how best to deploy resources , including new underwater search assets .",
   "If the underwater search comes up empty , it could ground the air search as well , CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said .",
   "`` If it does n't pan out , then all the equations that have been put in the mix to determine where debris might be ... all of that is for naught , '' he said .",
   "The next logical step after the underwater search is to `` rethink all of the information we have at hand , '' ocean search specialist Rob McCallum told CNN .",
   "An expanded search area might include the last 370 miles of the plane 's flight path , perhaps 15 miles on either side , he said .",
   "He also said it would make sense to turn to deep-towed sonar , which provides less resolution than the Bluefin-21 but about 10 times the range .",
   "If the search changes tacks , that does n't mean investigators did the wrong thing by looking where they did for the plane , said CNN analyst David Gallo , who co-led the search for Air France Flight 447 .",
   "Satellite and fuel consumption data , and possible pings from the plane 's flight data recorders led searchers to the part of the Indian Ocean they 're combing now , he said .",
   "`` It 's the place they had to look . ... Everything pointed to this area , '' he said .",
   "Going forward , he said , investigators may double or triple the size of the search area while using sonar to map the ocean floor `` so you see where every pebble is . ''",
   "`` I just do n't know how you leave this place before you take that area of the seafloor apart completely , '' he said .",
   "What happens if data recorders are found ?",
   "Investigators would love to find the flight data recorders from Flight 370 , a potential treasure trove of information into what happened to the jetliner and the 239 passengers and crew on board .",
   "If found , the `` black boxes '' probably would go to the Australian Transport Safety Board 's accident investigation lab .",
   "But the investigation is officially Malaysian , so that country 's officials would decide where the boxes would go .",
   "Australia is just one of a handful of countries that have the capability and technical know-how to decipher what 's inside a black box .",
   "The investigation into Flight 370 's disappearance is Malaysia 's responsibility . Australia is leading the search for the missing aircraft and participating in the investigation as an accredited representative .",
   "The Malaysian Cabinet approved the appointment of an international investigation team to look into the disappearance of Flight 370 , Hishammuddin said .",
   "The names of the members will be announced next week , he added . He also said the team will not be looking at the criminal aspects of the investigation , which remain under the Royal Malaysian Police .",
   "`` The main purpose is to evaluate and determine the cause of the accident , '' Hishammuddin said .",

' '' Watch the best of the winners ' backstage remarks ''",
   "The Coens , who have been known for their arch style and oddball humor in films such as `` Fargo , '' `` O Brother , Where Art Thou '' and `` The Big Lebowski , '' received some laughs for Ethan Coen 's laconic acceptance speeches .",

   "He estimated that the `` immensely painful '' breakdown of the currency used by 17 countries would cost a minimum of $ 300 million .",
   "The European Central Bank said Wednesday it had stopped providing cheap money to some Greek banks after Greeks pulled about 800 million euros -LRB- $ 1 billion -RRB- in savings out of the banking system on Monday .",
   "It would not say which banks it had cut off , forcing them to turn to the Greek Central Bank for more expensive loans .",
   "The Hellenic Hotel Federation , meanwhile , said tourism revenue was plummeting .",
   "Hotel reservations have dropped 30 % to 50 % in different parts of the country , the trade group said .",
   "Greek voters punished the major parties at the polls earlier this month for the harsh budget cuts imposed by the country 's international lenders .",
   "The election left no party able to form a government , creating deep uncertainty about Greece 's ability to continue to meet the terms of its bailout package and therefore its debt obligations .",
   "The political deadlock is leading to concerns that Greece will not have a functioning government in place when it needs to make critical debt payments next month , which could in turn jeopardize its place in the eurozone , the group of 17 European Union countries that use the euro currency .",
   "And a crisis could quickly spread beyond Greece , one analyst warned .",
   "`` If Greece exits the euro it wo n't be alone . Others will exit , '' said Paul Donovan , a global economist with UBS bank .",
   "`` There would be bank runs across multiple countries , '' he predicted . `` Citigroup , for example , may not be exposed to Greece , but it may be exposed to Portugal , Spain , France . ... It may be exposed to a company that 's exposed to France or exposed to exports to EU . ''",
   "In a worst-case scenario , he said , `` you 're talking about widespread defaults in the corporate sector as well as the sovereign sector . It becomes very problematic . ''",
   "European leaders were united Wednesday in saying they want to help Greece stay in the euro .",
   "German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she is working to keep Greece in the eurozone",
   "`` Europe needs to show solidarity and help , particularly with growth , unemployment and development , '' she said .",
   "Merkel , a champion of forcing governments to balance their budgets in order to promote stable economic growth in Europe , said she regrets the suffering of the Greek people in the face of harsh government budget cuts .",
   "`` It 's very bitter , obviously , '' she said of the austerity measures that have left some Greeks struggling to pay for food or utilities .",
   "But , she said , `` Sacrifices had to be made . ... I think these are necessary measures that had to be taken . ''",
   "The European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund have been pumping money into Greece to keep the country in the euro and able to pay its debts , but they have demanded that the Greek government slash spending to get the funds ."

   "-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This is what happens when politics starts looking like a cult : Jeb Bush gets attacked for being a traitor to the conservative cause .",
   "The former Florida governor has been speaking with the freedom of someone not running for office , saying that both his father and Ronald Reagan would have had a hard time in today 's hard-right GOP and questioning the wisdom of Grover Norquist 's absolutist anti-tax pledge .",
   "That set off a fascinating public fight between Bush and Norquist , two faces of competing factions within Republican Party . It is the latest evidence of a growing GOP backlash against the ideological straitjacket Norquist has attempted to impose on governing in the United States .",
   "On one side is a vision of the Republican Party that is committed to reaching out beyond its base with a focus on governing responsibly in the national interest .",
   "On the other side is a Republican Party driven by ideological activists and special interests , elevating pledges over principled but pragmatic solutions .",
   "The Norquist pledge commits signers to oppose all tax increases on individuals or businesses in any circumstances as well as changing deductions or credits unless they are revenue neutral .",
   "This skirmish started when Bush was asked about the pledge : `` I ran for office three times , '' he explained . `` The pledge was presented to me three times . I never signed the pledge . I cut taxes every year I was governor . I do n't believe you outsource your principles and convictions to people . ''",
   "The common-sense statement was regarded as a shot across the bow to Norquist , who quickly went on CNN 's `` The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer '' to push back , saying that Bush had `` stepped in it '' and `` really misspoke and insulted Romney '' because Mitt Romney had fallen in line and obediently signed the pledge .",
   "Escalation occurred this week when Bush said , `` Ronald Reagan would have , based on his record of finding accommodation , finding some degree of common ground , as would my dad -- they would have a hard time if you define the Republican Party -- and I do n't -- as having an orthodoxy that does n't allow for disagreement , does n't allow for finding some common ground . '' He added , `` Back to my dad 's time and Ronald Reagan 's time -- they got a lot of stuff done with a lot of bipartisan support , '' saying that Reagan `` would be criticized for doing the things that he did . ''",
   "This statement has the advantage of being both opinion and fact . Reagan achieved his administration 's agenda through cooperation with liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill , the House speaker . There were deep philosophical differences between the two but also a capacity to work together .",
   "Both Reagan and Bush -- and for that matter even Barry Goldwater -- would be accused of violating a number of litmus tests currently considered deal-breakers by conservatives . But let 's look closer at one in particular : taxes .",
   "Of course , Reagan championed lower tax rates , but he also signed off on a number of smaller tax hikes to help address revenue shortfalls and most importantly backed a bipartisan 1986 bill that closed loopholes as part of a simplification plan that raised revenues to help deal with the deficit .",
   "This inconvenient fact is often denied by Norquist and other activists because it is their prime objection to attempts to find a `` grand bargain '' on deficits and debt , along the lines of the recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission .",
   "In pursuit of a reality check , take a look at this quote : `` We 're going to close the unproductive tax loopholes that have allowed some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their fair share . In theory , some of those loopholes were understandable , but in practice they sometimes made it possible for millionaires to pay nothing , while a bus driver was paying 10 % of his salary , and that 's crazy . It 's time we stopped it . ''",
   "That might sound straight out of President Barack Obama `` Buffett Tax '' playbook -- which conservatives routinely attack as `` class warfare '' -- but in fact it is the sainted Reagan speaking in 1985 .",
   "Add to that the fact that the first President Bush backed a bipartisan deficit reduction plan that included a 2-to-1 spending cut to tax revenue formula and you have the kind of data that drives Norquist nuts .",
   "Here was his response to Jeb Bush on this front : `` There 's a guy who watched his father throw away his presidency on a 2:1 -LRB- ratio of spending cuts to tax increases -RRB- promise . ... And he thinks he 's sophisticated by saying that he 'd take a 10:1 promise . He does n't understand -- he 's just agreed to walk down the same alley his dad did with the same gang . And he thinks he 's smart . You walk down that alley , you do n't come out . ''",
   "The angry defensiveness of the statement , the thinly veiled threats and thuggish imagery , has all the signs of someone who worries that he might be losing a rational argument .",
   "As it turns out , Norquist has reason to be concerned . It 's not just Jeb Bush . A growing number of Republicans are rejecting his pledge . Oklahoma conservative Sen. Tom Coburn called the pledge 's effective veto of deficit reduction plans `` ridiculous '' when talking with Erin Burnett on `` OutFront . ''",
   "Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina on Tuesday declared his independence from the pledge , saying , `` We 're so far in debt , that if you do n't give up some ideological ground , the country sinks . ''",
   "Add to those voices seven other Republican U.S. senators -- from Maine 's Susan Collins to Iowa 's Chuck Grassley to Wyoming 's John Barrasso -- and 11 Republican House members , ranging from centrist New Yorker Richard Hanna to tea party Floridian Allen West .",
   "The bottom line is that a growing number of Republicans are deciding to throw off the ideological straitjacket to get serious about actually reducing the deficit and the debt . It is a courageous move at a time when cultlike group-think dictates that the pledge must be signed or your political career is dead in the water .",
   "The choice between Bush 's and Norquist 's vision of the Republican Party is ultimately no contest at all . It 's the difference between responsible governance and agitated activism , a growing party or a shrinking one . And of course in the end the only pledge that really matters is the Pledge of Allegiance .",

   "-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Recent headlines focusing on the rash of pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia should instead focus on the humanitarian crisis driving Somalis to commit crimes on the high seas , an international aid group said Thursday .",
   "Somalia 's population have suffered from a lack of the most basic services .",
   "An estimated one-third of Somalia 's population desperately needs emergency aid , the international agency Oxfam said , as donors to Somalia met in Brussels , Belgium .",
   "`` Without economic opportunities offering alternatives to criminality , and without law and order to curb these activities , then the massive economic returns of hijacking ships will continue to drive piracy , '' Robert Maletta , policy adviser for Oxfam , said in a news release .",
   "`` The international community must urgently focus their attention on finding ways to assist the millions of people in desperate need , '' Maletta said .",
   "Somalia , which is racked by poverty and conflict , has not had a fully functioning government since 1991 , when its president was overthrown in Mogadishu , the capital . Drought and rising food prices have added to the nation 's problems , according to Maletta .",
   "`` Families are finding it difficult to meet their most basic needs , as prices for basic food items are at record high levels , '' he said .",
   "Not only do civilians need emergency aid , they also need protection from military abuses , aid groups said .",
   "`` Since Somalia 's security forces have committed so many violent abuses against civilians , efforts to strengthen them also need to make them more accountable , '' said Georgette Gagnon , Africa director for Human Rights Watch .",
   "The combination of security and humanitarian assistance is necessary to curb piracy in the region , which borders the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean , aid groups said .",
   "The April 8 hijacking of the U.S.-flagged cargo ship Maersk Alabama made headlines worldwide when its American captain , Richard Phillips , was held hostage by four Somali men .",
   "Phillips was rescued four days later , after U.S. Navy snipers fatally shot three pirates . The fourth suspect , Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse , was brought to New York to face federal piracy charges .",
   "Ships with aid supplies destined for countries in the region , including Somalia , also have been hijacked in the Indian Ocean .",
   "Pirates held a ship carrying U.N. food aid for 100 days in June 2005 . Two years ago , a cargo ship and crew delivering U.N. aid to Somalia were held and released after 40 days .",
   "The Maersk was going to the coastal town of Mombasa , Kenya , to deliver relief supplies intended for various countries in the region , including Somalia ."

   "Jeffs ' phone privileges have been suspended for 90 days , added Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokeswoman Michelle Lyons .",
   "While refusing to elaborate on the content of the conversations , Lyons said that Jeffs was found guilty of making conference calls on several occasions . `` It was obvious to us he was talking to a group of people , '' she said .",
   "The leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , Jeffs is serving a life-plus-20-year term in Texas for sexual assault . He was convicted last August of the aggravated sexual assaults of a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old girl that Jeffs claimed were his `` spiritual wives . ''",
   "The state criminal justice department announced in late December that it had initiated an investigation into allegations that Jeffs used a prison phone to preach to his congregation on Christmas .",
   "Records show that Jeffs made two phone calls on December 25 , said Jason Clark , a Criminal Justice Department spokesman .",
   "`` It would be a violation of the rules if the person called were to place the call on speaker phone or record the conversation . The Office of Inspector General has asked us to suspend the accounts of certain individuals on his calling list while they continue to investigate , '' Clark said . He declined to identify those people .",
   "Texas inmates are allowed to call as many as 10 people who have registered with the offender phone system vendor . Calls can be up to 15 minutes in length , and offenders are limited to 240 minutes of phone time per month . All calls are recorded and monitored except those between an inmate and his attorney .",
   "Jeffs remains isolated in protective custody in the state 's Powledge Unit prison facility near Palestine , Texas .",
   "`` He has no cellmate . No prison job . And the only time he leaves it -LRB- his cell -RRB- is for a shower and recreation , '' Clark said .",

The mainstream Mormon church renounced polygamy more than a century ago .",
   "Many sect members have disavowed Jeffs in light of his criminal convictions , while others are defending him and calling his conviction on sexual assault charges an act of persecution .",

   "-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I count 105 football movies on Wikipedia 's `` list of sports films . ''",
   "There is a 1998 one called `` The Garbage Picking Field Goal Kicking Philadelphia Phenomenon , '' a title I know nothing about , except that it obviously had no use for commas or hyphens .",
   "There is a silent one , 1925 's `` The Freshman , '' about a milquetoast whose teammates use him in practice as a tackling dummy .",
   "There is a 1976 one called `` Gus , '' about a mule who kicks field goals .",
   "-LRB- Not a true story , I believe . -RRB-",
   "The 105th -LRB- chronologically -RRB- on this list is `` Draft Day , '' a tale of a fictional NFL executive -- he is played by Kevin Costner , king of sports cinema -- that opens Friday at a theater near you . From the trailer I have seen , it looks pretty good .",
   "Raising the question :",
   "Has there ever been a GREAT football movie ?",
   "I mean truly great , not just good . A masterpiece . A film you seriously could rank among your 100 best of all time .",
   "All right , all right , all right , as Matthew McConaughey would say , let 's take a look at some of those 105 movies on this here list .",
   "-LRB- `` American football '' is the category , which is just to let our CNN friends in Asia , Europe and South America know that you can go look for YOUR favorite football films under the category `` soccer . '' -RRB-",
   "OK , for openers , what does and does n't qualify as a football film ?",
   "For example , `` Silver Linings Playbook '' -LRB- 2012 -RRB- is not , even though its title sure does sound like one . Football gets talked about a lot , but a football movie , it is not .",
   "`` M * A * S * H '' -LRB- 1970 -RRB- also is not , even though it ends with a football game . The movie itself had nothing to do with football .",
   "`` Horse Feathers '' -LRB- 1932 -RRB- ends with a game . It makes the list , if only because Professor Wagstaff -LRB- Groucho Marx -RRB- wants to know : `` Have we got a college ? Have we got a football team ? Well , we ca n't afford both . Tomorrow we start tearing down the college ! ''",
   "There are two versions of `` The Longest Yard '' -LRB- 1974 and 2005 -RRB- , two of `` Brian 's Song '' -LRB- 1971 and 2001 -RRB- , two about legendary Alabama coach Bear Bryant -LRB- 1984 and 2002 -RRB- , one of which has Bear played by the somewhat less legendary Gary Busey .",
   "There are `` true '' stories about Knute Rockne , Tom Harmon , Frankie Albert , Elroy `` Crazylegs '' Hirsch , Rocky Bleier , Ernie Davis , Ernie Nevers and more , some of which contain scenes that are actually factual .",
   "In `` Invincible '' -LRB- 2006 -RRB- , a bartender -LRB- played by Mark Wahlberg -RRB- named Vince -LRB- as in invincible -RRB- gets to play for the Philadelphia Eagles . It really happened . In `` Paper Lion '' -LRB- 1968 -RRB- , the writer George Plimpton -LRB- played by Alan Alda -RRB- gets to play for the Detroit Lions . It sort of happened . It was actually in a team scrimmage , not in an NFL exhibition game , as in the film .",
   "There is 1993 's `` Rudy , '' about a small dude -LRB- played by Sean Astin -RRB- who gets to play with a Notre Dame team made up mainly of big dudes . There is 1981 's `` Grambling 's White Tiger , '' in which a white dude -LRB- played by master thespian Bruce Jenner -RRB- gets to play with a college team made up mainly of black dudes .",
   "A couple star Dennis Quaid . A couple star the Rock . I like both these actors , although both would have been badly miscast playing Rudy .",
   "A couple star Burt Reynolds , who actually played a little football in school .",
   "Sandra Bullock , who probably did not play a lot of football in school , won an Oscar for 2009 's `` The Blind Side , '' in which she demonstrates to future NFL star Michael Oher how to throw a block . Nice scene . Totally made up . Oher later wondered `` why the director chose to show me as someone who had to be taught the game of football . ''",
   "Because that 's show biz !",
   "Costner 's new one , `` Draft Day , '' concerns the NFL 's Cleveland Browns , with their general manager maneuvering to acquire the No. 1 pick of the college player draft . The Browns need any help they can get , never having won a Super Bowl .",
   "I appreciate that in Costner 's career he has played cowboys , lawyers , naval officers , Robin Hood , Eliot Ness and guys obsessed with JFK . I am nevertheless always pleased to find him in a sport-related role . I 'd watch him do anything , except maybe fight Rocky or play soccer .",
   "Has there ever been a football film classic , you ask ?",
   "Hmmm , probably not the one with a team coached by John Wayne , nor the one with a team coached by Goldie Hawn . Oh , and probably not `` Against All Odds '' -LRB- 1984 -RRB- , a remake of the film-noir mystery `` Out of the Past , '' for which instead of a private detective , the main character was changed by some Hollywood genius to -- duh -- a pro football team 's injured wide receiver !",
   "Ah , but a few keepers do exist . A half-dozen , in no particular order :",
   "-- `` All the Right Moves '' -LRB- 1983 -RRB- was a drama about a high school kid , good , not great , played by a young Tom Cruise , who basically finds out that if your coach feels like it , he sure can mess up the rest of your life .",
   "-- `` North Dallas Forty '' -LRB- 1979 -RRB- was a realistic look , with plenty of farce thrown in , at the behind-the-scenes activities of a pro football team , including a martinet of a coach and a number of players who indulge in very unsportsmanlike conduct .",
   "-- `` Harvard Beats Yale , 29-29 '' -LRB- 2008 -RRB- is a documentary , often as witty as the headline that inspired it . It looks back on a November 23 , 1968 , football game unforgettable to everybody involved in it , including a Harvard lineman you might have seen in another movie or two , Tommy Lee Jones .",
   "-- `` Brian 's Song '' -LRB- 1971 -RRB- , the original , not that lame reboot of 30 years later , deals with teamwork , friendship , rivalry , race relations , terminal illness , you name it . Acted impeccably by Billy Dee Williams and James Caan , this was a fine bromance .",
   "-- `` Jerry Maguire '' -LRB- 1996 -RRB- has had its cute lines regurgitated for so long -- `` show me the money , '' `` you had me at hello '' -- that its memorable premise is oft forgotten , that being the value of loyalty , to a partner , to a principle , to an employer , to a client . For a romantic comedy , it 's actually a pretty fair drama .",
   "-- `` Friday Night Lights '' -LRB- 2004 -RRB- took a book that offended some of the good folks of Odessa , Texas , exposing the lows as well as the highs of high school ball . In time , many came to accept what a significant story this is , in literature and film , the latter with a letter-perfect script and A-plus cast .",
   "Others out there in movie land might prefer the life lessons of 2000 's `` Remember the Titans . '' Or even a fossilized relic like 1940 's `` Knute Rockne , All American , '' in which a dying 25-year-old George Gipp -LRB- played by Ronald Reagan -RRB- tells his old coach Knute to `` go out there with all they 've got and win just one for the Gipper , '' which they do .",
   "Me , I 'd remake that one .",

   "-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- The major broadcast networks are deep in the trenches of upfronts week , rebuilding their fall lineups for the future . But some people remain trapped in the past \u00e2 $ '' specifically last week , when NBC finally canceled `` Community '' after five seasons of almost canceling `` Community . ''",
   "Rumors immediately began to circle that `` Community '' would get picked up for a long-prophesied sixth season by someone \u00e2 $ '' Hulu , or Comedy Central , or I guess now WGN America is a thing ? Those rumors led in turn to counter-rumors that Community showrunner/messiah/demonic inspiration Dan Harmon did n't actually want `` Community '' to continue . And there were probably other rumors , like the rumor about how `` Community '' star Danny Pudi 's appearance in `` Captain America 2 '' was intended to set up a future Marvel spin-off directed by Justin Lin where it turns out the characters on `` Community '' were the New Warriors the whole time .",
   "EW : Community ' season 5 - A visual analysis",
   "Harmon has now taken to Tumblr to clarify his position , in a surprisingly serene post directed at Community fans . `` I 'm getting tweets from some anxious sounding fans , '' writes Harmon , `` Tweets that make me anxious because I feel like I 've made THEM anxious with my silence . '' He admits to some reticence to continue with the show : `` When Sony called me on Friday with the news , there was brief discussion at the end of the call about the concept of the show living elsewhere , and I was definitely in the ` eh ' column . '' But do n't assume too much from that : `` I said ` eh ' on a Friday afternoon , I will change it to a ` sure , let 's talk ' on Monday morning and Sony can do their thing . I 'm not going to be the guy that recancels cancelled Community . ''",
   "EW : ` Community ' canceled",
   "Harmon cautions that `` there are lots of reasons a Community resurrection could be difficult . '' But he also has a nice message for `` Community '' fans :",
   "`` I honestly think you can totally sit back and relax for this chapter . I know you do n't feel relaxed but I mean you do n't have to worry that someone on this planet is n't aware of this show 's value to its audience . There are actually astronauts on a space station right now saying `` we get it , you love Community '' in Chinese . You have done your thing . ''",
   "It 's worth reading Harmon 's whole post , which features , among other things , Harmon expressing a bit of skepticism about how the new system of TV can actually wind up exploiting fanbases , `` like a corporation is doing you a favor by feeding you low grade opiate through a regulated tube . '' Meanwhile , rumors persist that NBC is in development on a new limited-run straight-to-series British Import drama starring Katherine Heigl , Feeding You Low Grade Opiate Through a Regulated Tube .",

   "If home is where the heart is , a new survey suggests that most people are n't sure exactly where they live . More than half of people can not pinpoint the exact location of the human heart on a diagram , and nearly 70 percent ca n't correctly identify the shape of the lungs , according to the survey .",
   "This lack of knowledge is n't just embarrassing -- it could lead to a poorer quality of health care , some experts say .",
   "In the study , published in the journal BMC Family Practice , a research team surveyed 722 Britons -- 589 hospital outpatients and 133 people in the general population . They gave the volunteers four diagrams of human figures and asked them to choose the one that showed the correct size and location of a specific organ . -LRB- For example , the heart diagrams showed various size organs on the far left side of the chest , directly in the center , anchored on the center/left chest , and on the right side of the chest . -RRB-",
   "Overall , people knew less basic anatomy than the researchers expected -- even those patients being treated for a specific condition involving that organ . Participants generally answered half the questions correctly , including 46.5 percent who knew which drawing represented their heart . In all , 31.4 percent correctly identified the lungs , 38.4 percent the stomach , 41.8 percent the thyroid , and 42.5 percent the kidneys .",
   "The intestines and bladder were the most easily identified , with 85.9 percent and 80.7 percent , respectively , answering the question correctly . Health.com : Are you cholesterol smart ? Take this quiz",
   "There was little to no improvement compared with a similar study conducted in 1970 , says lead author John Weinman , Ph.D. , of King 's College London . In that study , subjects correctly identified eight major body parts about half of the time . -LRB- The researchers used the same body parts from the 1970 study and added three more : the pancreas , gallbladder , and ovaries . -RRB-",
   "Given the accessibility of the Internet and the prominence of health stories in the news media today , Weinman 's team expected that people would now know more about their body .",
   "Weinman says he would n't be surprised if a study based in the United States produced similar results -- or worse . `` I imagine they would be similar , but there could well be regional variation , depending on which part of the U.S. the participants were from , '' he says . `` Actually , I asked one of my colleagues , who is from the U.S. , and she felt that Americans might be worse because , to quote her , ` Very many Americans do n't even know where New Jersey is , so how would they know where their pancreas is ? ' '' Health.com : Eat Smarter in your 30s , 40s , and 50s",
   "That may sound harsh , but time and again , U.S. studies have shown that doctors overestimate how much their patients understand about their conditions and treatment .",
   "Adam Kelly , Ph.D. , an assistant professor of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine , in Houston , Texas , conducted a 2007 study , that showed that doctors overestimate patient literacy and that a lack of patient knowledge leads to poorer care . Kelly believes the problem could be `` even more profound '' in the United States , although a similar study has not been conducted in America .",
   "Still , anatomy may not be the best measure of health literacy , says Sandeep Jauhar , M.D. , the director of the heart failure program at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center , and the author of `` Intern : A Doctor 's Initiation . '' Health.com : Computer games that boost your memory",
   "`` They would like us to draw the conclusion that because the patients ca n't identify these organs anatomically that that is an indication of low health-care literacy -- and that may or may not be true , '' he says . `` I work with heart failure patients , and whether they can identify where their heart is is not so important to me as long as they know which medicines to take and when . ''",
   "Many patients with heart failure , unfortunately , do n't know which medicines to take , ca n't identify their symptoms , and do n't follow up with their doctors , Jauhar says . `` So health illiteracy is definitely a big problem , '' he adds . `` I just do n't know that this is the best study to show that Americans or Europeans are illiterate when it comes to their health care . ''",
   "The study suggests that patients with liver disease and diabetes may be the most health-literate : They were the only two groups to do better than the general population when identifying their affected organ . Overall , 75.3 percent of those with liver disease could find the liver -LRB- versus 45.9 percent in the general population -RRB- and 53.7 percent of diabetics could locate the pancreas -LRB- versus 30.8 percent -RRB- . Health.com : How I survived a heart attack at 43",
   "`` It is possible that patient-education material for people with diabetes may help to increase their knowledge -LSB- of the pancreas -RSB- , but it is still only at the 50 percent level , '' Weinman says . `` The same explanation may also be true for liver disease , but it may be a chance finding due to the sampling of patients for this study , and it really needs replicating in other larger studies to be certain it is a robust finding and to search for possible reasons for it . ''",
   "Weinman says there 's a mountain of evidence to prove that effective communication from doctors increases patient satisfaction and understanding , leading to better clinical outcomes and improved adherence to treatment . Health.com : I lost my insurance , stopped my diabetes medication , and had a heart attack",
   "Jauhar agrees that health literacy improves not only the quality of health care , but also life expectancy . `` Health literacy is clearly very important , and how well patients are versed in their own health care is probably just as important a factor in determining longevity as genes or socioeconomic status , '' he says . `` These are important factors in how long someone lives .
