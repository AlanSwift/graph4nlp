   "-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What a week it 's been for Formula One ace Nico Rosberg .",
   "A new wife , a World Cup win for his beloved German football team and now a new contract with the Mercedes team .",
   "Rosberg heads to his home grand prix in Germany this weekend on cloud nine -- and still leading the 2014 world championship by four points from Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton .",
   "First came the wedding , as the 29-year-old married childhood sweetheart Vivian Sibold in Monaco last week .",
   "The celebrations carried on as Rosberg enjoyed a rare race free Sunday by watching Germany defeat Argentina to lift the World Cup for a fourth time .",
   "The Mercedes driver -- who had sportingly invited French Lotus driver Romain Grosjean to watch Germany defeat France in the quarterfinals after qualifying for the British Grand Prix -- plans to mark Germany 's triumph with a special helmet for his homecoming race .",
   "He will race around Hockenheim with football 's World Cup trophy at the centerpiece of a black , yellow and red design .",
   "Rosberg , the son of 1982 F1 world champion Keke , also goes to Germany with a multi-year contract extension in his back pocket .",
   "The former Williams racer , who joined Mercedes when the Silver Arrows returned to the sport in 2010 , has signed on for an unspecified number of seasons .",
   "`` I 'm looking forward to the next years together , '' said Rosberg , who has raced to six victories with the German team . `` We will keep pushing to win even more races -- and hopefully championships . ''",
   "Mercedes motorsport chief Toto Wolff said : `` Nico 's speed , commitment and focus have all helped to give clear direction and to drive the team forward since 2010 .",

   "Rosberg made his F1 debut with Williams in 2006 but his reputation has grown at Mercedes , particularly as he proved equal to the sport 's seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher during their three years as teammates .",
   "Since replacing Schumacher in 2013 , Lewis Hamilton has provided another benchmark for Rosberg to measure himself against .",
   "The English 2008 world champion is generally perceived to be the quicker driver but Rosberg has shown in 2014 that he is developing into a more rounded racer .",
   "Hamilton signed a three-year contract when he joined Mercedes with the deal due to expire at the end of 2015 .",
   "From junior teammates and friends , Rosberg and Hamilton are now locked in an intriguing battle for the 2014 world title .",
   "Rosberg has won three races with Hamilton , who has lost valuable points with two retirements , taking five grand prix victories as the season reaches its halfway point .",
   "After Hamilton 's victory at the British Grand Prix put him back in the title hunt , Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda predicted of his Mercedes charges : `` They will fight until the end like you do not believe to be world champion . ''",
   "Rosberg may already be enjoying an annus mirabilis but he still has his eye on the prize he really wants -- his first F1 world title ."

   "RIO DE JANEIRO , Brazil -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Brazilian TV host denies authorities ' charges that he orchestrated the murders of drug dealers and other criminals to generate sensational footage for his show .",
   "TV host Wallace Souza is accused of ordering hits on criminal rivals and then covering the deaths for ratings .",
   "Wallace Souza , a state legislator and former host of a police TV show called `` Canal Livre , '' also was a drug trafficker , officials say . And to get rid of the competition -- and drive up ratings -- he would order that criminal rivals be killed and then would have his camera crews arrive first on the scene , authorities say .",
   "`` In truth , they went as far as creating acts , '' said Thomas Augusto Vasconcelos , intelligence secretary for Amazonas state . `` It 's been determined that the crimes were committed in order to generate news for the program . ''",
   "Souza has denied the accusations , and his lawyer has criticized key testimony and questioned the investigation .",
   "`` In all the investigations carried out by the public minister and the police , up to now they have not presented any technical evidence of any type , '' attorney Francisco Balieiro said on Brazilian TV .",
   "State officials say Souza faces charges of forming a criminal gang , corrupting testimony , drug trafficking and illegal possession of firearms . He remains free because of legislative immunity , officials say . Watch report on Souza 's former show , charges he faces ''",
   "State Attorney General Otavio Gomes told the Agencia Folha news outlet that Souza 's gang has been linked to six slayings . But prosecutor Pedro Bezerra told the news outlet he could not bring murder charges against Souza for lack of concrete evidence .",
   "The Amazonas State Justice Tribunal , which held a hearing on the accusations , said the criminal complaint was based on testimony by former Souza associate Moacir Jorge da Costa . After Jorge 's arrest , he talked about the gang 's reputed activities , including slayings .",
   "Souza 's lawyer , Balieiro , said police and public ministry officials did not have standing to investigate the TV show host because he is a legislator . Furthermore , Balieiro said , Jorge 's testimony was obtained in an irregular manner .",
   "According to the state public minister , who brought the charges against Souza , the legislator 's son , Raphael , belonged to the criminal gang . Raphael Souza has been convicted of homicide , drug trafficking and illegal gun possession .",
   "Fifteen people connected with Souza , among them police officers and a chief , have been arrested .",
   "Souza , a former police officer who left the force more than 20 years ago after being implicated in a fuel theft case , received the most votes of any candidate in the last election in Amazonas state . His TV show went off the air last year after the investigation into his possible criminal involvement intensified .",
   "He lives in the jungle city of Manaus , the capital of Amazonas state , a region of Brazil known for its prevalent lawlessness . Souza would often rail on his lunchtime show about the killings and other atrocities being committed in the area .",

   "-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Recent headlines focusing on the rash of pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia should instead focus on the humanitarian crisis driving Somalis to commit crimes on the high seas , an international aid group said Thursday .",
   "Somalia 's population have suffered from a lack of the most basic services .",
   "An estimated one-third of Somalia 's population desperately needs emergency aid , the international agency Oxfam said , as donors to Somalia met in Brussels , Belgium .",
   "`` Without economic opportunities offering alternatives to criminality , and without law and order to curb these activities , then the massive economic returns of hijacking ships will continue to drive piracy , '' Robert Maletta , policy adviser for Oxfam , said in a news release .",
   "`` The international community must urgently focus their attention on finding ways to assist the millions of people in desperate need , '' Maletta said .",
   "Somalia , which is racked by poverty and conflict , has not had a fully functioning government since 1991 , when its president was overthrown in Mogadishu , the capital . Drought and rising food prices have added to the nation 's problems , according to Maletta .",
   "`` Families are finding it difficult to meet their most basic needs , as prices for basic food items are at record high levels , '' he said .",
   "Not only do civilians need emergency aid , they also need protection from military abuses , aid groups said .",
   "`` Since Somalia 's security forces have committed so many violent abuses against civilians , efforts to strengthen them also need to make them more accountable , '' said Georgette Gagnon , Africa director for Human Rights Watch .",
   "The combination of security and humanitarian assistance is necessary to curb piracy in the region , which borders the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean , aid groups said .",
   "The April 8 hijacking of the U.S.-flagged cargo ship Maersk Alabama made headlines worldwide when its American captain , Richard Phillips , was held hostage by four Somali men .",
   "Phillips was rescued four days later , after U.S. Navy snipers fatally shot three pirates . The fourth suspect , Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse , was brought to New York to face federal piracy charges .",
   "Ships with aid supplies destined for countries in the region , including Somalia , also have been hijacked in the Indian Ocean .",
   "Pirates held a ship carrying U.N. food aid for 100 days in June 2005 . Two years ago , a cargo ship and crew delivering U.N. aid to Somalia were held and released after 40 days .",
   "The Maersk was going to the coastal town of Mombasa , Kenya , to deliver relief supplies intended for various countries in the region , including Somalia ."

   "-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Texas prison officials have found polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs guilty of `` a major disciplinary infraction '' following an investigation into whether he violated policy by -- among other things -- preaching a Christmas day sermon from prison , a state spokeswoman said Monday .",
   "Jeffs ' phone privileges have been suspended for 90 days , added Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokeswoman Michelle Lyons .",
   "While refusing to elaborate on the content of the conversations , Lyons said that Jeffs was found guilty of making conference calls on several occasions . `` It was obvious to us he was talking to a group of people , '' she said .",
   "The leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , Jeffs is serving a life-plus-20-year term in Texas for sexual assault . He was convicted last August of the aggravated sexual assaults of a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old girl that Jeffs claimed were his `` spiritual wives . ''",
   "The state criminal justice department announced in late December that it had initiated an investigation into allegations that Jeffs used a prison phone to preach to his congregation on Christmas .",
   "Records show that Jeffs made two phone calls on December 25 , said Jason Clark , a Criminal Justice Department spokesman .",
   "`` It would be a violation of the rules if the person called were to place the call on speaker phone or record the conversation . The Office of Inspector General has asked us to suspend the accounts of certain individuals on his calling list while they continue to investigate , '' Clark said . He declined to identify those people .",
   "Texas inmates are allowed to call as many as 10 people who have registered with the offender phone system vendor . Calls can be up to 15 minutes in length , and offenders are limited to 240 minutes of phone time per month . All calls are recorded and monitored except those between an inmate and his attorney .",
   "Jeffs remains isolated in protective custody in the state 's Powledge Unit prison facility near Palestine , Texas .",
   "`` He has no cellmate . No prison job . And the only time he leaves it -LRB- his cell -RRB- is for a shower and recreation , '' Clark said .",
   "The 10,000-member church that Jeffs heads is a breakaway Mormon sect that openly practices polygamy in the twin border towns of Hildale , Utah , and Colorado City , Arizona , as well as on its Yearning for Zion ranch near Eldorado , Texas . The mainstream Mormon church renounced polygamy more than a century ago .",
   "Many sect members have disavowed Jeffs in light of his criminal convictions , while others are defending him and calling his conviction on sexual assault charges an act of persecution .",
   "A long-time follower of Jeffs recently said he had been ex-communicated after admitting to having sex with his wife -- a violation of an order that the sect leader apparently issued from behind bars . The church member spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue .",
