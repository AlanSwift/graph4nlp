# graph4nlp
Graph4nlp is the library for the easy use of Graph Neural Networks for NLP

## Packaged version for testing
Unfortunately, currently any CUDA related issues about dgl version need to be handled manually by the user. 
Suppose all the CUDA related dgl issues are fixed, then install our package from TestPyPI by this command
```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ graph4nlp -U
```

Note that the `-U` option is important since our library is rapidly iterating.
