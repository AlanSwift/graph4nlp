Dynamic Graph Construction
===========

Unlike static graph construction which is performed during preprocessing,
dynamic graph construction operates by jointly learning the graph structure
and graph representation on the fly. The ultimate goal is to learn the
optimized graph structures and representations with respect to certain
downstream prediction task.
Given a set of data points which can stand for various NLP elements such as words,
sentences and documents, we first apply graph similarity metric learning which aims
to capture the pair-wise node similarity and returns a fully-connected weighted graph.
Then, we can optionally apply graph sparsification to obtain a sparse graph.



Node Embedding Based Graph
-----------------
For node embedding based similarity metric learning, we are given a set of data points
and their vector representations, and apply various metric functions to learn pair-wise
node similarity. The output is a weighted adjacency matrix which is corresponding to a
fully-connected weighted graph. Optional graph sparsification operation might be applied
to obtain a sparse graph. Common similarity metric functions include attention-based and cosine-based functions.
Below is an example to call the API.

.. code-block:: python


    from graph4nlp.pytorch.modules.graph_construction import NodeEmbeddingBasedGraphConstruction

    embedding_style = {'single_token_item': True if config['graph_type'] != 'ie' else False,
                    'emb_strategy': config.get('emb_strategy', 'w2v_bilstm'),
                    'num_rnn_layers': 1,
                    'bert_model_name': config.get('bert_model_name', 'bert-base-uncased'),
                    'bert_lower_case': True
                   }
    graph_learner = NodeEmbeddingBasedGraphConstruction(
                                        word_vocab,
                                        embedding_style,
                                        sim_metric_type='weighted_cosine',
                                        num_heads=2,
                                        epsilon_neigh=0.6,
                                        smoothness_ratio=None,
                                        connectivity_ratio=None,
                                        sparsity_ratio=None,
                                        input_size=32,
                                        hidden_size=32,
                                        fix_word_emb=True,
                                        fix_bert_emb=True,
                                        word_dropout=0.4,
                                        rnn_dropout=0.4)



Node Embedding Based Refined Graph
-----------------
Unlike the node embedding based metric learning, node embedding based refined graph metric
learning in addition considers the existing edge information of the intrinsic graph when itâ€™s available.
Below is an example to call the API.

.. code-block:: python

    from graph4nlp.pytorch.modules.graph_construction import NodeEmbeddingBasedRefinedGraphConstruction

    embedding_style = {'single_token_item': True if config['graph_type'] != 'ie' else False,
                    'emb_strategy': config.get('emb_strategy', 'w2v_bilstm'),
                    'num_rnn_layers': 1,
                    'bert_model_name': config.get('bert_model_name', 'bert-base-uncased'),
                    'bert_lower_case': True
                   }
    graph_learner = NodeEmbeddingBasedRefinedGraphConstruction(
                                        word_vocab,
                                        embedding_style,
                                        0.2, # init_adj_alpha
                                        sim_metric_type='weighted_cosine',
                                        num_heads=2,
                                        epsilon_neigh=0.6,
                                        smoothness_ratio=None,
                                        connectivity_ratio=None,
                                        sparsity_ratio=None,
                                        input_size=32,
                                        hidden_size=32,
                                        fix_word_emb=True,
                                        fix_bert_emb=True,
                                        word_dropout=0.4,
                                        rnn_dropout=0.4)
