Batching
=========

In practice, we usually need to convert a collection of small graph into a large graph where each original small graph
is a connected component of the large graph. This operation is called `batching` in graph deep learning and is widely
applied to improve computing efficiency.

``GraphData`` provides interfaces for batching and unbatching graphs for training and inference. The ``to_batch()``
function takes a list of ``GraphData`` instances and returns a single ``GraphData`` which is the merged large graph.
On the other hand, users may use ``from_batch()`` to decompose a large graph generated by merging small graphs into a
list of ``GraphData``.
